### Project Íris
Íris is a bot in English, Spanish and Portuguese created and maintained up-to-date by KillovSky to WhatsApp Group "Legião Z", she have more that 200 commands and frequent update of fixes and new things.

### Another Language
Si quieres un tutorial en español, abre lo [Tutorial Español](https://github.com/KillovSky/iris/blob/main/.readme/es/README.md), para um português use o [Tutorial PT-BR](https://github.com/KillovSky/iris/blob/main/README.md).
To make your bot completely in another language, open [language](https://github.com/KillovSky/iris/blob/main/lib/config/config.json#2) and change from "pt" for "en" which is English or "es" for Spanish, there are no languages other than these - not yet.

### Personal Note
This software uses the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license, it's proibited the removal of credits, and i'm expending a LOT of time without gain nothing to make this better, please, do not remove the credits of my bot.
If you see someone stealing or who has stolen, show the truth, tell them it is plagiarism, is the only desire i have.

### Requiriments
- Two numbers at WhatsApp, one for owner and other for BOT.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) - LTS recommended.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) - For the Unix-Tools - Careful.
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) - For conversions.
- [Libwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) - Help the FFmpeg and other things.
- If needs help to install FFmpeg, view the [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows) for Windows 7/8, to Windows 10 see [SoundArtifacts](https://soundartifacts.com/pt/how-to/186-how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10-amp-add-ffmpeg-to-windows-path.html).
- To install LibWebP follow the same steps, but changing the folder name to LibWebP instead of FFmpeg.

To install all programs above at Linux, use that command:

```bash
> sudo apt install nodejs git ffmpeg -y
```

If have some errors at Node, try using the [Node Source](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions), remember, LTS version.
